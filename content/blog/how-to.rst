	**Vulnerable Household Support Networks (VHSNs)**	
	*In this post I'll describe a modality for social support and humanitarian aid such as cash transfer programming utilizing Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs).*
	**Vulnerable households (VHHs)**	


Vulnerable households (VHHs) 



VHHs in an area are identified via survey carried out by enumerators that seeks to understand which families in the community are most vulnerable and need support. Generally they are families where the head of household is a youth, elderly or very ill. See how Kenyan Red Cross works hard to identify vulnerable households.

A Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) like Sarafu is created and/or distributed regularly (similar to a basic income) in the area to VHHs as well as to all the households in the community in order to enable them to record mutual support among each other. Community members are asked to support the vulnerable families and each other with goods and services, using a CIC to record the support given.

For instance: a woman named Rehema who sells tomatoes may offer some tomatoes worth 20 KSH to a VHH. The VHH can record and show their appreciation by sending Rehema 20 CIC tokens using her feature phone.
- Rehema can now also appreciate her own friends family and even tomato suppliers by sending them CIC in return for their support, goods and services.

	**Vulnerable Household Support Network Members (NMs):**	


Vulnerable Household Support Network Members (NMs): 



those people that support the VHH by offering goods and services are traditionally not easy to objectively identify or quantify. By receiving a CIC a NM can record of their support in the whole community and around VHHs. This data is recorded securely and anonymously on a blockchain. Those NMs in the community that wish to share their blockchain address can be identified and capacity built / rewarded / supported by individual cash transfers.

	**Vulnerable Household Support Network - Identification:**	


Each user in the network has a unique address for their account on the blockchain that can be used to record every single CIC transaction. Any CIC transaction coming from a VHH can be viewed and audited as a record of support being offered to that VHH from members of the VHS-N. 



For instance a VHH uses their feature phone and sends 100 CIC to appreciate Rehema the sender and record her offer of 100 KSH worth of maize flour as support.

That gives us a way to measure and rank how much support Rehema has offered. Indeed we can see the whole network of users that have offered VHHs support. If we look at this whole network we can get a sum of all the support a person like Rehema has offered to ANY vulnerable household - and we can even rank her support for VHHs among ALL the NMs (who are CIC users). 



Say that Rehema’s amount of received CIC from VHHs (measuring her offers of maize flour) makes her in the top percentile of network members; Here in the example below we can see that she gave 46% of the total support in the community to a VHH.

The four people or businesses have received 6550 CICs over a month because of the support they offered to vulnerable households. They can choose to offer their information to the public or an aid organization in order to be recognized and potentially rewarded.

	**Vulnerable Household Support Networks (VHSNs) can identified using Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) transaction data and give aid organizations concrete and auditable proof of community support (POCS).**	


In this way ANYONE offering support, goods or services to Vulnerable Households can be identified,  acknowledged, rewarded to build their capacity. Because these CICs can continue circulating in the community as long as they are needed they can provide a long term community safety net, especially when Kenyan shillings are scarce or during or recovering from a crisis like COVID.

*Note that there are MANY other ways to define and identify CSNs: Including voting systems as well as identifying specific areas of support, such as: farming, education or food and water.

Let's get the potlucks started! Here is a short introduction to the methods we use for Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) potlucks and how they could be applied to any community – even on social media groups such as: WhatsApp, Telegram Discord, Facebook and so on.



These are all short iterative processes that can happen in cycles as the group learns by doing.

	**Step 0. Bringing People Together**	


This is its own challenge, especailly (physically) today- so I’m assuming you have or can pull together a group of people where each person brings something to the table/social media group (a church group, whatsapp friends etc). Think of this as a potluck (a.k.a braai, coroga, faith supper, hatch party or participatory dinner party) where everyone is bringing an ingredient to amazing dishes that you are all going to cook and eat together.

	**Step 1a. Resource Mapping**	


What ingredients do people have and what does everyone want to eat?! Have each person identify what their needs are and what they can offer - including goods, services and national currency. Share this list of offers and needs and see how well the community can meet its own needs and what is missing to have that perfect potluck.

	**Step 1b. Community Projects**	


From the needs and offers discussed are there any commonalities? Could the group decide on one or more community projects? (Collective farming, elderly care, open source software development... etc)



If there is consensus on projects the community would like to do as well as sufficient offers to do those projects – as well as needs being fulfilled by those projects and offers – then you have all the ingredients you need for a great Community Inclusion Currency (Potluck!). Now, solidifying (mixing) these resources toward your goals and projects involves commitment.

Now, solidifying (mixing) these resources toward your goals and projects involves commitment.

	**Step 2a. Reach Commitment**	


What can everyone commit to putting into the potluck? Individually and together we express what we can commit to accepting in return for the CIC we will create: our goods and services, our time on community projects and as well National Currency. 

	**Step 2b. Develop an Agreement**	
	* Creation: Based on what everyone is putting in: goods, services and national currency – how many CIC tokens should be created? How should they be connected to collateral valued in National Currency? We use a metric in Kenya that for every 1 CIC created there is 1 unit of national currency worth of commitments of goods or services as well as 0.25 national currency (collateral pool) bonded to it – this way the CIC can be spent on committed goods and services as well as cashed out to national currency – note that as well people can add national currency the pool.
	* Allotment: Based on the community projects and commitments  people offer how should the CIC be distributed? We take the full amount of CIC to be created and divide it in half – where 50% is divided in proportion to people’s commitments and the other 50% goes toward community projects – with designated managers.
	* n.b. There can be many other rules, such as taxation, demurrage, fines yearly recycling of the CIC. It is good to take time here to think about all the possibilities as you design your own financial system. 
	* Trade Balance: One core concept/commitment in CICs is the need for people to over time maintain a trade balance – accept as much as you spend, and spend as much as you accept. 


Now that all the ingredients are there and they have been mixed together your currency potluck is ready to divide and serve. Dish it out!

	**Now that all the ingredients are there and they have been mixed together your currency potluck is ready to divide and serve. Dish it out!**	
	**Step 3a. Develop a name for your CIC**	


Give your creation (CIC) a name! Both a long name and a short name – this will be the token name people see on their devices when trading. 

	**Step 3b. Mint and Distribute**	


These CICs are created and then distributed as per the rules decided. Note there are a lot of options on how to digitally or physically create these tokens and distribute them! See technical discussion below.

	**Step 4. Circulation - Let's eat!**	
	* The group can trade with themselves or anyone else by sending them the CIC tokens they have.
	* Anyone can do community projects and get paid by that community project manager in CIC tokens
	* Anyone can add national currency (or other market valued tokens) to the collateral pool and create more CIC.
	* Anyone holding a CIC can liquidate it and pull out the collateral behind it.
	**Step 5. Keep meeting and planning and starting over**	
	**No dinner party should last forever and one potluck is never enough! Ideally your CIC is humming along unlocking your collective untapped potential, but reassessment is key. How is the potluck going and how might we do better next time? Having a duration for your CIC and the community projects you create naturally gives rise to the next CIC – which can be created by a group liquidating the current CIC and creating another with the same process as above.**

	**Technically:**	


In Kenya we manually do the Mint and Distribute step on behalf of communities – but anyone with a bit of blockchain tech savy can deploy these contracts (we are working on makign this much easier). We mint a CIC/token and bond it to a collateral pool in a digital asset (such as USDC, XCHF - note a community could create it's own reserve currency basket). This process is called defining and deploying a smart contract on a blockchain. The contract is transparent and the rule for how it can be used need to be totally clear. The open source Bancor V1 Bonding Curve contracts can be augmented in many ways to suit the needs of the group. Also note that a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can be used to do much of the above process and distribution as well as maintain the contract – in lieu of a trusted contract deployer. There are a lot of options if you get stuck on this creation and distribution process - we are happy to discuss!

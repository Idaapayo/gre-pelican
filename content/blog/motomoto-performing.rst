We've started off the year with two new MotoMoto classes on Tuesday and Thursdays in Mombasa thanks to Burners without Borders. Each class consists of ten street living youth. We've begun giving them food after each session as a way of giving them focus. 



 



One of the students is George Kamau . George dropped out of school in second grade because his parents could not pay his school fees. He hasn't been able to find work and has lost hope. He is now addicted to glue sniffing. We hope to see George making it all the way through the program and eventually off the streets.

Martin Kimani is still spinning it up since 2009! The MotoMoto Circus programhas been working to reach street living youth through performing arts since 2009 when the project was given a kick start from Burners Without Borders. 



 



This week we had our Wednesday training and showcase at Makadara Grounds in Mombasa. These kids are trying to change their habits, support eachother and get off drug addiction and the streets. Martin is our lead instructor and works with different groups of street kids multiple times a week. We are also hoping to start a prison program in 2013 to reach those youth that are in jail often being subjected to hard labor.

Besides the great help we get from Burners without Borders. We are looking for help with donations of kevlar and old poi sets. If you are able to donate a roll of Kevlaror any other poi stuff that would be great!

We are also looking for volunteers in 2013. If you can teach poi or want to learn poi - think about doing it in Kenya!

Brief Historical Overview
***************************

Starting in 2010 Grassroots Economics worked with local communities to issue vouchers aka Community Currencies (CCs) as a medium of exchange with the belief that CCs could enable communities to develop a source of local credit based on productive capacity and local values, while creating a monetary system better suited to eradicate poverty and the multiple indicators of deprivation targeted by the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. After working with over a dozen communities by 2018 we began to support communities in digitizing their CCs.

2020 Survival Mode
********************

Starting in 2020 we embarked on the huge task of developing, refining and modularizing open source infrastructure that would enable communities to issue and manage their own Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs). CICs are blockchain contracts that enable a community to issue a digital voucher against claims of future production and create a possibility of conversion between that voucher to other similar vouchers.

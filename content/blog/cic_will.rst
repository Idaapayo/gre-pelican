Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Contracts contain multitudes. There are nearly infinite ways to use them to connect blockchain contracts (like Community Inclusion Currencies) for different use cases. Using them opens us up decentralized network topologies that we would never have dreamed of with old fashion stock exchanges and other financial instruments. The best part is that they can be used by anyone in the world with access to internet or even just an inexpensive phone using USSD/SMS.
